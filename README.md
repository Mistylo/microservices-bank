# Microservices Architecture Project

This project is a implementation of cloud-native microservices, built using Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, and other modern technologies. It is inspired by best practices in the industry and demonstrates how to develop, secure, monitor, and deploy distributed systems at scale.

## üöÄ Features

- Microservices architecture using Spring Boot
- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s)
- Configuration and deployment with Helm
- Communication via Kafka (Event-driven architecture)
- Database integration with MySQL
- Observability stack: Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, Tempo (LGTM)
- Authentication and authorization with OAuth2 and Keycloak
- Deployment to Google Cloud Kubernetes Cluster
